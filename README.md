# cisc849-project
Final project code for CISC849.

This project aims to use coalitional game theory to model rational choice of households to enter a lockdown with during a pandemic, based on exposure chance, social eagerness, and risk factor (i.e., trade-off between socialization and risk).

To run the code, use the command "python3.8 lockdown-model.py". All major parameters can be adjusted using the constants at the top of the file.
